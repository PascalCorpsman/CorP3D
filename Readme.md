# CorP3D

Cor(psman)P(hysic)3D is my try to implement a 3D-Physics engine.

#### Why this engine?

When i started coding i used [Newton](http://newtondynamics.com/forum/newton.php) but since version 3 i have had to much trouble getting it to work, and the older versions are not available as source, so i was not able to continue using Newton.

Next i tried [Kraft](https://github.com/BeRo1985/kraft) which is written in FreePascal and used in Castle Game Engine. I even tried to create first [Examples](https://github.com/PascalCorpsman/kraft_examples) as there is barely no documentation for Kraft. Creating this examples i figured out some "issues" and did not get any responce from the orig creator. So i had no choise as to abbandom this work too :/.

So what's next, well trying to write a own Physic engine ;).

To be honest i am not shure whether i will be ever able to get a working version, but at least i give it a try and even if i am not getting it to work i hopefully will be able to learn something, ..
